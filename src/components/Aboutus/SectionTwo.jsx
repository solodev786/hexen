            Welcome to HEXEN, where innovation meets passion! We are Muhammed
            Swalih and Muhammed Shijas, two friends with a shared love for
            technology and a dream to make a mark in the web development
            industry. Our journey began at MES Kalladi College, Mannarkkad,
            where a shared curiosity for coding and technology brought us
            together.
          </h1>
          <h1 className=" font-light md:w-4/5">
            From our school days, we had a solid foundation in programming,
            which only grew stronger as we learned new technologies and
            frameworks. Our college years were marked by a relentless focus on
            self-improvement and a commitment to staying updated with the latest
            in tech. We were average students academically, but our real
            education was happening outside the classroom, as we pursued our
            passion for coding.
          </h1>
          <h1 className=" font-light md:w-4/5">
            Our entrepreneurial journey started modestly. We began cold calling,
            emailing, and marketing on WhatsApp to local businesses, eager to
            prove our worth. It wasn’t easy – we faced many rejections and
            moments of doubt. But our persistence paid off when we landed our
            first project with a travel agency. The thrill of receiving our
            first advance payment was indescribable. We faced challenges, but
            our determination saw us through, delivering the project ahead of
            the deadline and earning our first income of 35,000 rupees. Buoyed
            by our initial success, we delved deeper into the world of business,
            learning marketing strategies, honing our skills, and expanding our
            network. We tackled a variety of projects, from e-commerce sites to
            delivery applications, each one a stepping stone to our growth.
          </h1>
          <h1 className=" font-light md:w-4/5">
            As our skills and confidence grew, so did our vision. We realized it
            was time to take a bold step forward and create something bigger. In
            our third year of college, we registered our company, HEXEN. Today,
            HEXEN is more than just a web development agency; it’s a team of
            dedicated professionals ready to take your business to new heights.
